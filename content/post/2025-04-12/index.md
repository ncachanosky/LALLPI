The first version of the **Latin America Left-Leaning Populism Index** is finally out. The 2025 version covers 21 latin american countries with data between 2000 and 2019.

Different to other indices, the index looks at **active** populism, that is how much of the populist *rhetoric* becomes *policy*.

A detailed discussion of the method can be found on this website's [documentation](/documentation) and in this working paper.
