The first edition of the L**atin American Left-Leaning Populism Index** (LALLPI) is finally here! The 2025 version covers 21 Latin American countries with data spanning from 2000 to 2019.

Unlike other indices, this one focuses on **active** populism—measuring how much populist rhetoric translates into actual policy.

A detailed discussion of the methodology can be found in this website’s [documentation](/documentation) and in this working paper.
