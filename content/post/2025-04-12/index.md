The first edition of the **Latin American Left-Leaning Populism Index** (`LALLPI`) is finally here! The 2025 version covers 21 Latin American countries with data spanning from 2000 to 2019.

Unlike other indices, this one focuses on **active** populism—measuring how much populist rhetoric translates into actual policy. Another feature of this index is its sub-division into **Economic** populism and **Institutional** populism.

A detailed discussion of the methodology can be found in this website’s [documentation](/documentation). The index's working paper is coming out shortly.
